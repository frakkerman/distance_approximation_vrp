## Environment

The code is written in Python 3.10. A requirements.txt details further requirements of our project. We tested our project on a Windows 11 environment.


## Folder Structure
The repository contains the following folders:

- **`data/`**: Contains the data used by FeatureEngineering and outputted by FetaureEngineering.
- **`FeatureEngineering/`**: Contains the main code for engineering features based on simulation data.
- **`MachineLearning/`**: Contains the main code for training various distance approximation machine learning models on the data.
  - **`Models/`**: Contains the machine learning models we used (linear regression, random forests, XGBoost, lightGBM, and neural networks), here we also save the models.
  - **`Preprocessing/`**: Contains various preprocessing functions, e.g., loading data, normalization, and feature selection.
  - **`Utils/`**: Contains utility functions, e.g., data loading and hyperparameter tuning using grid search and Bayesian optimization.
- **`Simulation/`**: Contains the main code for simulation: both for the stylized experiments and the Amsterdam waste collection case study (see paper).

Each folder in the root is a seperate project with a seperate `main.py`, such that users can use only the functionality that they want, e.g., only use the ML-models. If you want to test the complete pipeline, you will first need to obtain data using the simulation model, next engineer features, and finally train a ML-model. Next, you can use this ML model again in the simulation. Note that we already provide a dataset for the Amstedam case in the `data` folder.

We provide more details and usage instructions for each project in seperate README's in the folders in this project.


## To the make the code work

 * Create a local python environment by subsequently executing the following commands in the root folder
	* `python3 -m venv venv`
	* `source venv/bin/activate`
	* `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
	* `deactivate`
